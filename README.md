# NewsMediaSentiment

This project involves NLP concepts to drive sentimental opinion and scores of different News Media Sources such as CNN, Al Jazeera  for analyzing their opinions for different countries and continents at world level.

## Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence in which computers analyze, understand, and derive meaning information from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.

NLP is characterized as a difficult problem in computer science. Human language is rarely precise or plainly spoken. To understand human language is to understand not only the words but the concepts and how they’re linked together to create meaning. Despite the language being one of the easiest things for the human mind to learn, the ambiguity of language is what makes natural language processing a difficult problem for computers to master.
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python library that provides modules for processing text, classifying, tokenizing, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.

### Where is NLP applied?
There are several problems that we can deal with using Natural Language Processing, here are a few:
Text Classification
Language Modeling
Speech Recognition
Caption Generation
Machine Translation (Machine Translation)
Document Summarization
Question/Answer (Question Answering)

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis can help us decipher the mood and emotions of general public and gather insightful information regarding the context. Sentiment Analysis is a process of analyzing data and classifying it based on the need of the research.

These sentiments can be used for a better understanding of various events and impact caused by it. L. Bing [1] highlights that in the research literature it is possible to see many different names, e.g. “sentiment analysis, opinion mining, opinion extraction, sentiment mining, subjectivity analysis, affect analysis, emotion analysis, review mining”, however all of them have similar purposes and belong to the subject of sentiment analysis or opinion mining. By analysing these sentiments, we may find what people like, what they want and what their major concerns are.

### TextBlob

TextBlob is a python library for Natural Language Processing (NLP).TextBlob actively used Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) to achieve its tasks. NLTK is a library which gives an easy access to a lot of lexical resources and allows users to work with categorization, classification and many other tasks. TextBlob is a simple library which supports complex analysis and operations on textual data.

Positive Score is the count of positive words used in the article.
Negative Score is the count of negative words used in the article.
Polarity Score defines the sentiment of a sentence whether it is positive, negative or neutral. It lies between [-1, 1], -1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment.
Subjectivity Score quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. The higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information. Subjectivity lies between [0,1].
