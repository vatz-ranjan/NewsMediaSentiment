New strikes and protests from some of France’s leading unions are under way against a highly controversial pensions reform plan that has seen millions come out on the streets against it.
The proposed changes include raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increasing the number of years people must make contributions to receive a full state pension.
The reforms were at the heart of President Emmanuel Macron’s re-election campaign last year, but are proving deeply unpopular.
His cabinet says the changes are essential to prevent the pensions system from falling into deficit and younger people carrying the burden.
Here is what you need to know:
From 2027, workers will have to make social security contributions over 43 years rather than 42 years in order to draw a full pension. The additional year was already foreseen in a 2014 reform, but Macron is accelerating the pace of transition.
Guaranteed minimum pension income of not less than 85 percent of the net minimum wage, or roughly 1,200 euros per month at current levels, for new retirees.
After year one of retirement, the pensions of those receiving a minimum income will be indexed to inflation.
